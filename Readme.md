# Code
Some generic code is included in this repository that mainly pertains to processing freesurfer on the cluster and or R functions around parsing output and reorganising data.

# Authorship, usage and acknowledgements
If you are using the existing variables available from the shared datasets, you do not need to include anyone as co-authors. However, if you are using variables generated by others (for example imaging metrics processed using specific pipelines, polygenic scores, bespoke phenotypic variables), please contact the person who has generated the variables before using them. Please check with them re. authorship in accordance with the University's authorship guidelines (see: http://www.medschl.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CoS14_68-Authorship_Code_of_Practice-FINAL.pdf?04c0fc). If you are unsure if variables were generated by a specific user or were UKB default please contact Richard or Jakob to check. All freesurfer reconstructions were run by Richard Bethlehem using funding from the BRC (see acknowledgement below)

If you are creating a new variable and would like to make it available for others to use please include the following:    
1. A readme file with the description of the variables, your name and contact information, and details of use   
2. A file, or a link to a webpage (github, OSF etc) with detailed methods you used for generating the variables including the code.    

Finally, when making use of this resource please acknowledge the following funding sources that continue to make storage and processing of this dataset possible in your publications:

"This research was co-funded by the NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre to Richard A.I. Bethlehem and Edward Bullmore. The views expressed are those of the author(s) and not necessarily those of the NHS, the NIHR or the Department of Health and Social Care."
